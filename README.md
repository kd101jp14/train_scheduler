## About

* This project allows users to input train information and view relevant data in a table. Using Moment.js, the app calculates the train's next arrival time and how many minutes remain until the next train. In addition to the Moment.js calculations, the other key feature of this web application is the data persistence of information displayed in the table. The user's input and the related calculated values are stored in a Firebase database (server-side storage). Each time a user adds a new train, that train's information prepends to the top of the table and persists on the page.
