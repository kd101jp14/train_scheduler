## About

* This project allows users to input train information and view relevant data in a table. The app calculates the train's next arrival time and how many minutes remain until the next train. The key feature of this web applictaion is the data persistence of information displayed in the table. The user's input and the related calculated values are stored in a Firebase database (server-side storage). Each time a user adds a new train, that train's information prepends and persists in the table.
